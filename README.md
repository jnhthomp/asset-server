This website serves as a page for recruiters, hiring managers, or potential clients to view in order to learn about me, contact me, and see my experience/prior work. It was created with React and designed and created by myself from the ground up.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** <!--JavaSCript =>--><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="40" height="40"/></a><!-- Node.js --><a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original-wordmark.svg" alt="nodejs" width="40" height="40"/></a><!-- Express --><a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/express/express-original-wordmark.svg" alt="expressjs" width="40" height="40"/></a>
This servers as a simple server to host content that is re-used such as project images, copies of documents such as contracts for freelancing and resumes. This allows me to make updates to these files here and have these updates reflected in multiple places.

### How to install/use
1. ```$npm install```
2. ```$npm start```

## Optimizations
- It might be interesting to create an admin page for this server. This could allow me to update/upload files via a web interface (and from anywhere rather than just machines that are authorized to update this repository)
  - This might be more effective to move the files out of the server application itself and into a database where CRUD actions can be more easily performed
## Lessons Learned
- Hosting on Heroku
- Creating simple express applications
